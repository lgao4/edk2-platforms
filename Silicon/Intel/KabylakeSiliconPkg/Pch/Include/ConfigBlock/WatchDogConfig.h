  This policy clears status bits and disable watchdog, then lock the
  WDT registers.
  while WDT is designed to be disabled and locked by Policy,
  bios should not enable WDT by WDT PPI. In such case, bios shows the
  warning message but not disable and lock WDT register to make sure
  WDT event trigger correctly.
