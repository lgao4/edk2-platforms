/**
  Performs silicon pre-mem policy initialization.

  The meaning of Policy is defined by silicon code.
  It could be the raw data, a handle, a PPI, etc.

  The returned data must be used as input data for SiliconPolicyDonePreMem(),
  and SiliconPolicyUpdateLib.SiliconPolicyUpdatePreMem().

  1) In FSP path, the input Policy should be FspmUpd.
  Value of FspmUpd has been initialized by FSP binary default value.
  Only a subset of FspmUpd needs to be updated for different silicon sku.
  The return data is same FspmUpd.

  2) In non-FSP path, the input policy could be NULL.
  The return data is the initialized policy.
