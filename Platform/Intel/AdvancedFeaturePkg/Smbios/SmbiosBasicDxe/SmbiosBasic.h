/**
  Add an SMBIOS record.

  @param  Smbios                The EFI_SMBIOS_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  SmbiosHandle          A unique handle will be assigned to the SMBIOS record.
  @param  Record                The data for the fixed portion of the SMBIOS record. The format of the record is
                                determined by EFI_SMBIOS_TABLE_HEADER.Type. The size of the formatted area is defined 
                                by EFI_SMBIOS_TABLE_HEADER.Length and either followed by a double-null (0x0000) or 
                                a set of null terminated strings and a null.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           Record was added.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  Record was not added due to lack of system resources.
